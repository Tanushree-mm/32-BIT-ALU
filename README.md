# 32-BIT-ALU

**OBJECTIVE**

Write Verilog code for a 32-bit ALU supporting:

4 logical operations: AND, OR, NAND, NOR

4 arithmetic operations: ADD, SUB, MUL, etc.

Model ALU behavior using:

case statement

if statement

Verify functionality using a testbench

Synthesize both versions and compare results

Identify critical path, area, power, and timing

**DESCRIPTION**

The ALU will take in two 32-bit values, and control line. An Arithmetic unit does the
following task like addition subtraction, multi-fiction and logical operations. As the input is
given in 32 bit we get 32 bit output. The arithmetic will show only one output at a time so a
selector is necessary to select one of the operator.
